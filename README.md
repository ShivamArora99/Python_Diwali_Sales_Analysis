These repositories serve as a digital canvas where I share my evolving expertise and experiences with a broader audience on GitHub. Within this collection, you'll encounter a mix of original creations and adaptations, which might include repositories containing code I've personally written, or even entirely unique projects that I've undertaken. My primary objective is to provide valuable resources for fellow learners and enthusiasts, enabling them to draw inspiration, gain insights, and further their knowledge.

                  I have performed sales analytics, which involves some basic data cleaning and answering business questions.
